				<h2>Mission</h2>
			</div>

			<div class="about-us--card">
				<p>
					Unity Support was created by Sarah Roczniak in 2020 with the primary goal of bridging the gaps for servicing participants on NDIS Plans. As a registered NDIS provider, we can ensure that no
					participant is left behind. Unity Support is determined to keep a client-focused approach in all aspects of support.
				</p>

				<h2>Sarah Roczniak - Founder</h2>
			</div>

			<div class="about-us--card">
				<p>
					Sarah has a lived experience and sought to understand more about mental health by completing a Bachelor of Arts (Psychology, Criminology & Justice). During and after her studies, she started
					working as a Peer Support Worker. This was the beginning of a now 8-year career supporting those with disabilities to achieve their goals. Sarah is supporting Unity Support participants with
					Psychosocial Recovery Coaching and Support Coordination across all of Perth Metro.

				<h2>What is Psychosocial Recovery Coaching?</h2>
				<p>
					Psychosocial Recovery Coaching is a new support within NDIS from July 2020. Recovery Coaches should help participants with a psychosocial disability manage day to day tasks in a sometimes
					complex world. Working alongside other supports, such as family, friends, other services and helping to implement an effective NDIS Plan will help pave the way for meaningful life. If this
					type of support sounds a little bit broad, it's because it is. No two participants are the same and therefore this service is flexible to ensure that people who need it, are able to access
					it. Whilst utilising Recovery Principles, Recovery Coaches aim to have you managing more of your own day to day life.
				</p>

			<div class="bottom-grid2">
				<h2>What is Support Coordination?</h2>
				<p>
					Support Coordination is a service that helps participants learn more about their NDIS Plans and coordinates the supports within it. A Support Coordinator will ensure that a mixture of funded
					supports are booked and implemented so that it is not left to the participant or loved ones to manage. Usually these supports are based around ensuring that the participant has access to
					services that will help them access community life, therapies, maintain relationships and anything else funded within an NDIS plan. In short, a Support Coordinator will put your plan into
					action and help it run smo0thly, ensuring it stays based on the participantâ€™s needs.
